 The brief was to produce a game in Javascript over the course of a week. The final product was designed as a simple RPG. 
 The player starts with 3 directions to travel in. Each movement randomly generates a room that can contain a monster, 
 health or attack upgrade. After a certain number of moves, the player wins. Monsters are generated from a Dungeons and 
 Dragons API.

 We used Bootstrap to style the frontend.
